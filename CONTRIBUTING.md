## Development Workflow

### Tier-Based Development
- **Legacy Tier**: Read-only, archived implementations
- **Stable Tier**: Production-verified components with mathematical proofs
- **Experimental Tier**: Active development and validation

### Component Promotion Process
1. Develop in experimental tier
2. Complete mathematical verification
3. Achieve 95% test coverage
4. Pass performance benchmarks
5. Undergo security audit
6. Promote to stable tier

### Jupyter Notebook Standards
Each component requires structured notebook development:
1. `01_mathematical_verification.ipynb`
2. `02_implementation_design.ipynb`
3. `03_integration_testing.ipynb`
4. `04_performance_benchmarking.ipynb`
5. `05_documentation_generation.ipynb`
