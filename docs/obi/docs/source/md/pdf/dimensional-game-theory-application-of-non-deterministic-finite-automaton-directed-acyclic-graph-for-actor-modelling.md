Abstract
This document formalises the Dimensional Game Theory (DGT) framework
and its Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) functor extension, integrates
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) topology for HDIS (Hybrid Directed Instruction
Systems), and provides algorithmic and verification tooling (ODTS, CRIF). It is
intended as a single-file LaTeX source suitable for Overleaf compilation and inclu-
sion in the project repository. The text contains formal definitions, algorithms,
pseudocode, diagrams, and a practical integrity metric (CRIF) for witness ledger
verification.

1 Introduction
1.1 Background: From Classical Game Theory to Dimensional
Extensions
A short motivation for DGT: traditional game theory analyses strategic agents with fixed
action sets and payoffs. DGT extends this by adding “strategic dimensions” that are
activated contextually and by building functorial mappings between observer and actor
spaces.
1.2 Role of Phenomenology in Computational Modelling
Phenomenological elements (phenotype, phenomemory, phenovalue) are included as first-
class types to model human-in-the-loop systems and to ground coherence metrics in
measurable observables.
1.3 HDIS as Foundation: Human-in-the-Loop Coherence Sys-
tems
HDIS is introduced as the architectural seed for active systems that observe, adapt, and
self-heal. Implementations include DIRAM, DIPAD and the SemVerX hot-swap engine.
1.4 Research Aim and Scope
This document unifies formalism, algorithms and reference implementations (links to
repositories) for DGT, NFA functor extension, ODTS and HDIS integration.
2 Theoretical Framework
2.1 Dimensional Game Theory (DGT): Core Definitions
Glossary and Notation
N Natural numbers {0,1,2,...}.
Z Integers {...,−2,−1,0,1,2,...}.
Q , R, C standard sets of rational, real and complex numbers.
DGT-specific symbols
F,G Functorial mappings between behaviour spaces.
F ·G Composition: (F·G)(x) = F(G(x)); inDGTcompositionmaybenon-deterministic
through functor-lifting to power-set codomains.
F ⋆G Coherence operator (lossless interaction), defined in Section 2.6.
Φ,Ψ Phenomenological functors: Φ maps raw observations to phenovalue; Ψ maps in-
tent/actor transforms.

2.2 Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) as Behavioural
Models
Define an actor as A = (Q,Σ,δ,q ,F) where δ : Q × Σ → 2Q. Actor policies are
NFA 0
modelled as NFA transitions and functor lifts let us compose NFAs with DAG topologies.
2.3 Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) in System Coherence
Nodes model actor components; edges model observer-consumer transactions and co-
herence receipts. A DAG G = (V,E) is used so that topological traversal and functor
composition are well-defined.
2.4 Actor-Observer-Consumer Paradigm
Each node implements an Observer that produces phenovalue and a Consumer that acts
on it. The pair yields dual receipts stored in the witness ledger.
2.5 Phenomenological Type System (Phenotype, Phenomem-
ory, Phenovalue)
Formal type definitions and interfaces for phenomodels, including minimal API examples
(pseudocode) for observing and consuming layers.
2.6 Coherence Operators and Functor Composition
Define algebraic operators used to combine functors: union U, coherence ⋆, disjoint ÷,
and null ⊥. A working definition:
H = F ⋆G = C(F,G)·(F ·G)
with C(F,G) ∈ [0,1] the coherence measure (see Section 6).
3 Mathematical and Algorithmic Foundation
3.1 State Transition Functions and NFA Functor Definition
Formalisation of lifted transitions: if δ is the NFA transition, we define the functor-lifted
transition δ♯ mapping distributions or power-set states.
3.2 Functor Composition: F · G Operator Interpolation
Describe the interpolation semantics when F and G are stochastic/non- deterministic
functors. Provide pseudocode for composition and for estimating C(F,G) via sampled
traces.
3.3 Set-Theoretic Mapping: Union, Disjoint, Pairing, Division
Formal set operations used to reason about lossless vs lossy joins in the DAG.
