## Risk Management Protocol

### Resource Constraint Scenarios
- IF resource limitations impact both tracks THEN prioritize critical path items based on:
  1. Regulatory/compliance requirements
  2. Technical dependencies
  3. Business value prioritization

### Technical Impediment Response
- IF technical blockers are encountered THEN:
  1. Document impediment in issue tracking system
  2. Evaluate workaround options
  3. Adjust timeline expectations
  4. IF impediment persists beyond 5 days THEN escalate to stakeholder review

### Quality Assurance Gates
- Each phase transition requires formal quality review
- IF quality metrics are not met THEN:
  1. Document deficiencies
  2. Implement remediation plan
  3. Conduct regression testing
  4. Re-evaluate against quality criteria

## Documentation Requirements

Each phase transition requires the following documentation updates:
1. Technical specification document
2. Test case documentation
3. Implementation notes
4. Performance metrics
5. Known limitations

## Version Control Protocol

- Feature branches correspond to specific objectives within each phase
- IF feature implementation is complete THEN:
  1. Submit pull request
  2. Conduct code review
  3. Run automated tests
  4. IF all checks pass THEN merge to development branch

## Interdisciplinary Collaboration Framework

- Weekly cross-track synchronization meetings
- Shared documentation repository
- Technical knowledge transfer sessions after each phase
- Cross-functional code reviews for shared components
